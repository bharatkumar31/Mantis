      "That confirms it. With the relay clicking, no dashboard warning, and no sound from the horn itself, the relay and fuse are both fine — the fault is downstream at the horn unit or its ground connection. I'm now fairly confident this is a loose ground wire or a worn-out horn unit.\n\nHere's how to check it:\n1. Remove the front apron panel (4 screws, Phillips head).\n2. Locate the horn behind the headlight assembly — it's the small black disc with two wires.\n3. Check the ground wire (usually black) for corrosion or a loose bolt connection.\n4. If the connection looks clean, tap the horn body gently while a helper presses the button — a working unit will buzz faintly even if it's too quiet to hear normally.\n5. If there's still no sound, the horn unit itself needs replacing — it's a direct swap, no soldering required.",
